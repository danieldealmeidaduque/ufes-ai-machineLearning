## About The Project

<p align="justify">
    The objective is to compare the accuracy of five supervised machine learning methods, namely ZeroR (ZR), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NBG), KMeans Centroids (KMC), K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree (AD), in classifying the wine database from scikit-learn. I aim to present the results of this comparison through an accuracy table and boxplots, which will showcase the visual differences between the classifiers. Additionally, I will perform a statistical analysis by comparing each method pair-wise using both the paired t-test and the Wilcoxon test. The goal of this analysis is to establish whether there are any significant statistical differences between the methods.
